          This page is where you'll get to know me beyond my resume. I'll share
          my journey in tech, my passions like Formula 1 and at the moment
          cybersecurity, and what drives me as a developer. Think of it as a
          quick intro to who I am, what I do, and why I love it. Stick around
          maybe we'll build something great together!

          Why I Chose UE for My Computer Science Studies
        </h1>
        <p className="text-gray-200 tracking-normal text-justify m-2 p-2">
          I decided to pursue my Computer Science degree at the University of
          the East (UE) because of its strong CHED accreditation, ensuring a
          high-quality education that meets national standards. At the time, it
          was the most cost-effective institution that delivered top-notch
          Computer Science education, making it the perfect choice for me as a
          student seeking both value and quality.Plus, red has always been my
          favorite color, and UEâ€™s vibrant school colors made me feel even more
          connected to its spirited academic community. The combination of
          academic credibility, affordability, and a lively campus environment
          made UE the ideal place for me to grow as a future IT professional.
