          Why I Chose UE for My Computer Science Studies
        </h1>
        <p className="text-zinc-500 text-xl tracking-normal text-justify m-2 p-2">
          I decided to pursue my Computer Science degree at the University of
          the East (UE) because of its strong CHED accreditation, ensuring a
          high-quality education that meets national standards. At the time, it
          was the most cost-effective institution that delivered top-notch
          Computer Science education, making it the perfect choice for me as a
          student seeking both value and quality. Plus, red has always been my
          favorite color, and UEâ€™s vibrant school colors made me feel even more
          connected to its spirited academic community. The combination of
          academic credibility, affordability, and a lively campus environment
          made UE the ideal place for me to grow as a future IT professional.

          Formula 1 
        </h1>
        <p className="text-zinc-500 text-xl tracking-normal text-justify m-2 p-2">
          In my free time, one of my favorite hobbies is following Formula 1.
          Thereâ€™s something incredibly intriguing about the perfect blend of
          speed, strategy, and cutting-edge technology. Itâ€™s not just about fast
          cars racing around a track itâ€™s a complex sport where every
          millisecond counts, and tiny decisions can change the outcome of an
          entire race. What fascinates me most is the constant battle between
          teams to innovate and gain even the slightest edge, whether it's
          through aerodynamics, tire strategy, or pit stop timing. The rivalry
          between drivers, the unpredictability of weather and crashes, and the
          global scale of the sport from Monaco to Japan make every race feel
          like an adrenaline-filled chess match. Watching F1 isn't just
          exciting itâ€™s a deep dive into precision, teamwork, and relentless
          competition, and thatâ€™s what keeps me hooked.
